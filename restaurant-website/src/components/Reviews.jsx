The \"spicy\" option offered a substantial level of heat; I may opt for the \"medium\" level on my next visit. I selected the combo meal, priced at $15, which included a chicken sandwich, a chicken tender on Texas toast, fries, and Special Sauce. The meal was exceptionally flavorful, and I would recommend this establishment."

The person working was very friendly and gave us the recommendation of the chicken sliders. I ordered one slider in the hot seasoning and one slider in the extreme. Hot was a good heat and the extreme lived up to its name. If you pass by this place and like hot chicken I would recommend giving it a try. The food is cooked to order and the fries and sauce are pretty solid as well."
